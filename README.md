rythmer
=======
Measure a rythm frequency. I used it to measure the bpm of all song
in my library, based on which I compile playlist for my spinning
workout (or whatever training I do with the aid of music).

PS: The real target of this project is to practice objective-c and
    GNUstep/Cocoa development

Usage
-----
Beat the rythm with Cmd-B, until you see a stable average.

To do
-----
- Spectral analyzer which estimate the beat rythm directly reading
  the audio file.
- Better graph of the rythm trend
